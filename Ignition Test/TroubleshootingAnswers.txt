Troubleshooting Answers

Answer: Right off the bat I go to Vision tab and then Windows.  Inside there I click on Refrigeration window
and then see compressor one blacked out.  I click then right click and run the diagonitcs tool.  It give me 4 
errors, hoa:Error_Config,
pressureDischarge:Error_config,
controlValue: Error_Config,
indicator value:error_Config
Seeing this I want to go check on those tags and make sure they are pointing to the correct tag.
The current state of HOA OPC Item Path is, 
"[TroubleshootingSimulator]_Meta:Refrigeration/Compressor{CompressorNumber}/hoa"
My updated is, 
"[TroubleshootingSimulator]_Meta:Refrigeration/Compressor1/hoa"
So I see it was pointing to not the correct compressor.  Refreshed tag and verified it worked.
Next I'll check pressureDischarge path,  Its current path is,
"[TroubleshootingSimulator]_Meta:Refrigeration/Compressor{CompressorNumber}/pressureDischarge"
Again looks like we got to update the correct path 
"[TroubleshootingSimulator]_Meta:Refrigeration/Compressor1/pressureDischarge"
Now it looks like after updating the tag there are no more erros on diagonitcs tool.

Answer: Ok so now I'm going to the Alarm Status page and see the display path changning between Discharge Valve
and King Valve Open. Also the name saying Valve change.  From the question I'm guessing they are wanting the display
path corrected. So now I'm going to go look at the valveDischarge tag and look at the alarms event.  I see it has a 
Valve change state with a display Path of,
"Discharge Valve "+
if("{Value}","Open","Close")
It should be 
"Discharge Valve " + if({[.]valveDischarge.value}>=100, "Open", "Closed")
This gives it the location of the tag and condition it to 100 and give it an argument if its lower then 100 its closed
and if its great then 100 its open.

Answer: Ok going into the Vision client under Edit users. I see the entire page is broken so let me take a look.
After looking at the Gateway I seen Allow User Admin needed to be disabled.
In the Designer I found that in the Project Properties under Vision and permissions it was only allowing Manager.
I add Operator and logined into operator and seen it was working now.

Answer: First I seen when I click on tower 1 on the main window for Refrigeration I see it puts me into Tower number 2.
I go and see that there is only 1 pop up that says its tower 2.  So I rename it Tower Detail 2 and copy and paste and rename that one to 
Tower Detail 1.  Then under Template Properties on Tower 1 I updated it to be Tower number 1.

I see the problem is when you sort out the values the color doesnt have with it.  After looking at the scirpting for configureCell
I see in self.data.getValueAt(rowValue,"pH") > 9: and so on needs to actually be self.data.getValueAt(rowIndex,"pH") > 9: to correctly update
the statement to look at the index itself.

Answer: I found that the averages for the data was broken.  Before it was avg and after reading documentation its supposed to be average.  After updating that 
the data looks to be good now. Where I did this was under report, page 1, table data summary, and text shape 1 and 2

Answer:  I see that under the Gauge had the same as compressor.  I went to templates and seen I could discard override put it greyed it out.  I reenable override and 
the gauge came back up.  Saved and checked in vision client and seen data coming thru properly.

Answer:  I found that Mary couldn't login into perpsective.  Just to verify I went to the gateway and went under her group and changed her password to password. 
After that I tried to login again and still nothing.  So I went into the designer and check the secuirty settings.  I seen in Identity Provider that it was default 
so I changed it to her Troubleshooting_Users profile.  Then I went and checked Perspective Permissions and made sure it was Authenticated permissions.  After saving
the changes I went and tried to log back in and I could now.

Answer:  When navigating to the Map it just throws us back at the home page.  Going into designer I went to the menu and looked at items.  Under item 2 which is the map 
I see that target was :/.  It should be :/map based off the page config menu.  After saving it succeessfully went to the map.

Answer: So when navigating between pages the towers page doesnt show Header page for navigating to other pages. I went to the Perspective page config and saw it was only on
/ home page.  I deleted it and added it to Shared settings so any page you are on you'll have that docked view so you can nagvigate thru to all pages correctly.

Answer:  When going to Compressors page there doesnt seem to be anything there.  Going back to the Page Config for perspective I see that /compressors needed to be /Compressors so it grabs 
that view.

Answer:  After looking and seeing that it was showing the same I went and looked at the tower view page.  Going into tower 1 tab I seen the parms was tower 1 but when I went to tower 2 it said tower 1
in parms.  I changed that to tower 2 and saved and seen the correct data comming thru.
